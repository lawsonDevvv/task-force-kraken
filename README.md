# task-force-kraken

## Introduction
---
Hey there. It seems you've stumbled upon Task Force: Kraken's Bot. Welcome aboard. Before you go ahead and start contributing, there are a **couple** of rules you need to follow:

1.) No troll PRs/Issues. Please. You're not funny.

2.) If 1 more fucking person pings me in Discord and asks me how to submit a PR, I will kill you.

3.) Google is your best friend. Do not expect me to answer all your questions. Google it.

4.) No, you cannot have permission to write directly to master. No, I will not automatically accept your PRs (have patience).

5.) If it's a semi-big change, submit an issue first. Otherwise, PRs.

6.) If you have any issues, harass me @PossiblySebo#0001

## How to Contribute
Now that we're familiar with the do's and dont's of contributing, let's get started on getting this show on the road.

## Installation
Before jumping right into a command prompt, we need our own fork. A fork is essentially a copy of the repository, but on our account, so we can make direct changes without the need of a pull request!

Once you've made a fork of the repository, clone that repository (your version).

Open a command shell. Assuming you have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed to your local machine, clone this repository.

To clone a repository, cd into wherever you'd like the repository to be installed.
Then run the following:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/your_username_here/task-force-kraken.git
```
Once run, you should see a fresh new folder in whatever folder you were in, named "task-force-kraken" or "task-force-kraken-main", or something to the effect of that.

Now that we've got that, we need to access it! Run the following:
```cmd
cd "task-force-kraken"
```
You should replace `task-force-kraken` with whatever the actual folder is named.

Now we should be inside of the directory, ready to do cool stuff!

If you don't know how to commit to a local repository and/or push to a remote, google it. Not explaining it here.
